## Project Description

We have made an interactive whiteboard and display board. The purpose of this product is to maximize the available space on the whiteboard. You can easily store the information that you have written on this board and convert it to read-only and increase the amount of data you can access via one whiteboard. The information can later be retrieved in correspondence to its context and displayed on the monitor screen.
Construction and Working
The product consists of a wooden frame with and attached whiteboard and monitor.

There are 5 buttons on a panel:

  #### Button A: ASSIGN

  It denotes that the user is going to write a heading and its information.
  Camera 1 is activated:
  It is a mobile camera and is used to clicking the heading/title/formula for which we need to write the corresponding information/derivation

  #### Button B: Keyword click

  The user places the mobile camera in front of the keyword they have written.
  On clicking this button, the keyword's picture is taken and it is converted from handwriting to text and stored at the backend.

  #### Button C: Information click

  Once the user has written the information corresponding to the heading, on pressing the button, the picture of the information is clicked and stored against the keyword for it, as a JPEG/PNG file at the backend.
  The second camera is fixed with an extended rod.

  #### Button D: Recall

  On pressing this button, the recall function is invoked. It denotes that the user is going to write another heading. So on the backend we would search if this keyword has been stored or not.
  Camera1 is activated.

  #### Button E: Recall keyword click

  The user would place the mobile camera in front of the keyword they have written. This is the recall keyword.
  On clicking the button, the photo of the recall keyword is taken. The handwritten data is converted to text.
  Then on the backend we search if this word has already been stored. If it is there then the corresponding information is displayed on the monitor.
  If the word is not already stored then a default image is shown on the monitor.
  It is used for clicking the picture of the information which is written alongside its heading/keyword.
